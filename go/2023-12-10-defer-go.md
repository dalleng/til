# `defer`
In Go, the `defer` statement is used to postpone the execution of a function until just before the containing function returns. This feature is commonly utilized for cleanup tasks. Below is an example demonstrating how `defer` is employed to close a file:

```
package main

import "os"

func main() {
    f, err := os.Open("input.txt")
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatal(err)
    }
    defer f.Close()
}
```

In this example, `defer f.Close()` ensures that the `Close` method on `f` is called when the `main` function finishes execution, regardless of whether it exits normally or due to an error. This guarantees that the file is properly closed, preventing resource leaks.
