# Tmux scrolling

To begin scrolling you need to press `Ctrl-b` + `[` ,assuming `Ctrl-b` is set as the prefix, and then use the arrow keys (or hjkl if you use vi mode) to move around.

To scroll a little bit faster you can use the following, adding the key bidings for vi mode as that is what I use.

| Function       | Key Combination |
| -------------- | ----------------|
| Half page down | C-d             |
| Half page up   | C-u             |
| Next page      | C-f             |
| Previous page  | C-b             |
