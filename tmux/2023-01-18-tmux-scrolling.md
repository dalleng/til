# Tmux scrolling

To begin scrolling you need to press `Ctrl-b` + `[` ,assuming `Ctrl-b` is set as the prefix, and then arrow keys or hjkl if you use vim mode.

To scroll a little bit faster you can use the following, adding the key bidings for vim mode as that is what I use.

|Function       |vi |
|---------------|---|
|Half page down |C-d|
|Half page up   |C-u|
|Next page      |C-f|
|Previous page  |C-b|
