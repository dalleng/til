# `bisect` module

The `bisect` module provides functions that help maintain lists in order without
doing full sorting after each insertion.

It is also useful for searching in a sorted list. Search is done in logarithmic time, so it's better than linear search.

`bisect.bisect_left(a, x)` returns the insertion point for x in a. If values of x are already inserted in returns the position to the left of
the first instance of x.

`bisect.bisect_right(a, x)` (same as `bisect.bisect`) returns the insertion point for x in a. If values of x are already inserted in returns the position of the right of
the last instance of x.

`bisect.insort_left(a, x)` calls `bisect.bisect_left` to get the insertion position and then calls `a.insert`.

`bisect.insort_right(a, x)` calls `bisect.bisect_right` to get the insertion position and then calls `a.insert`.
