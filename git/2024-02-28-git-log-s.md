# Search codebase history using `git log -S`

The `-S` flag for `git log` lets you search the entire repo history and check if a given
string was ever present.

Example:
`git log -p -S"string_to_search" --source --all`

`-p`: Adds the diff.
`--source`: Includes the ref (branch or tag) in which `string_to_search` was added or removed.
`--all`: Include all branches and tags.
