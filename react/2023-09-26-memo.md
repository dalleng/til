# `memo`

`memo` let's you skip re-rendering a component if its props did not change. The component returned from the `memo`
function is said to be memoized. Normally in React all child components are re-rendered when their parent component
re-renders, that is not the case for memoized components as long as their props haven't changed.

`memo(Component, arePropsEqual?)`

The second argument `arePropsEqual` let's you supply a function with custom logic to evaluate equality. The default equality comparison
uses [`Object.is`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/is).
