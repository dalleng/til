# `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` to debug queries when using testing-library

The `screen.logTestingPlaygroundURL()` method logs a URL for the [Testing Playground](https://testing-playground.com/) to the console. 
The testing playground will show the element tree for the component rendered and queries can be tested.
