# JS `console.count()` and `console.countReset()` functions

The `console.count()` method logs the number of times that this particular call to `count()` has been called and
`countReset()` resets the counts. Both of these functions are extremely useful when debugging `react` code, for example 
when trying to count how many times a component has been rendered.

Also both can take an optional `label` parameter in order to have multiple counters.
