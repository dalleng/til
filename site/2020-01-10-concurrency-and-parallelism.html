      <h1>Concurrency and Parallelism</h1>
<p>Came across a really simple and good explanation of the difference between
concurrency and parallelism in Rob Pike's talk <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmg1CF3gZQ0">"Concurrency is not Parallelism"</a>.</p>
<p>From Rob Pike's slides:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Concurrency is about dealing with a lot of things at once.</p>
<p>Parallelism is about doing a lot of things at once.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So I think the main takeway of the talk is that for either concurrency
or parallelism you actually need to think how to decompose a problem into
independent subtasks. Concurrent decomposition.</p>
<p>After decomposing the problem, actually having concurrency or parallelism
boils down to how subtasks are scheduled. So, for the case of a multicore
cpu you can actually schedule subtasks to run simultaneously on different
cores thus achieving parallelism. For the case of a single core cpu you can
only execute subtasks one at a time but context switch between them, thus
making progress on all of them in the same period just not simultaneously,
thus having concurrency but not parallelism.</p>
