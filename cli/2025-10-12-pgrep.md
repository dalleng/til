# Pgrep to find PIDs by name

Without any options, `pgrep <name>` only returns the PIDs of processes matching the name `<name>`. For example:

```shell
$ pgrep vim 
23084
23085
```

A more useful combination of flags is `-fl`:

`-f`: matches against the full argument list, not just the process name.
`-l`: long output, also prints the process name. When combined with `-f` prints the whole argument list.

Some examples:

```shell
$ pgrep -l vim
23084 nvim
23085 nvim
```

```shell
$ pgrep -fl vim
23084 lvim -u /Users/diegoallen/.local/share/lunarvim/lvim/init.lua main.go
23085 lvim --embed -u /Users/diegoallen/.local/share/lunarvim/lvim/init.lua main.go
```
